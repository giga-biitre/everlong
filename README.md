  Hello, I've waited here for you...<br><b> Everlong </b></br>
  Tonight, I throw myself into <br></br> And out of the red <br></br>Out of her head, <b> she sang </b><br></br>
  Come down and waste away with me<br></br> Down with me <br></br> Slow, how you wanted it to be <br></br> I'm over my head <br></br>
Out of her head, <b> she sang </b><br></br><b>And I wonder<br></br></b>
<b>When I sing along with you</b><br></br>If everything could ever be this real forever<br></br>If anything could ever be this good again<br></br>The only thing I'll ever ask of you<br></br>
You've got to promise not to stop when I say when<br></br><b>She sang</b><br></br>Breathe out<br></br>So I can breathe you in<br></br>Hold you in<br></br>And now<br></br>I know you've always been<br></br>Out of your head<br></br>
Out of my head,<b> I sang </b><br></br><b>And I wonder</b><br></br>
<b>When I sing along with you</b><br></br>If everything could ever feel this real forever<br></br>If anything could ever be this good again<br></br>The only thing I'll ever ask of you<br></br>You've got to promise not to stop when I say when<br></br><b>She sang</b><br></br><b>And I wonder</b><br></br>If everything could ever feel this real forever<br></br>If anything could ever be this good again<br></br>The only thing I'll ever ask of you<br></br>
You've got to promise not to stop when <b>I say when</b><br></br>
